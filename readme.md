# Codeclan Week 01 Day05 - Weekend Homework

## Knowledge to be Demonstrated :

* Basic Ruby Methods, and data structures (Arrays & Hashes)
* Git/Github version control
* Test Driven Development Incorporating [Minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest)

## Instructions:

Tests will be provided which relate to the functioning of a pet shop.

Your task is to write methods which will - very confidently - make those tests pass.

Bonus points for crafting your own tests and subsequent methods.

## Project Information:

pet_shop_spec.rb - contains tests written with respect to minitest.
pet_shop.rb - contains methods created in response to said tests.
readme.md - markdown file for good housekeeping.

## Notes
* A FOR loop won't cycle through a hash, you need to access the hash using a keys
* A FOR loop within a FOR loop is used to access an array within an array
* Whenever you need to access a hash, use the appropriate key for direct access path
* RETURN will boot you out of the function. Not to be used where a complete iteration through an array is needed.
